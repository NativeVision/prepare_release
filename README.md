# prepare_release

Release Script for Viro/ViroCore

## Prerequisites

1. clone `viro` repo
2. clone `virocore` repo
3. put this script in the following place:

```console
ParentFolder/
- viro/
- virocore/
- prepare_release.sh
```

4. Follow installation instructions for both viro/virocore. A good way to check this is to run `prepare_release.sh` in both viro/virocore.

## NOTE

Issues on this script will likely be ignored. This is a tool that is used internally to build and check if a build is ready.
